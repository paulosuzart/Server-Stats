# server-stats

This is a micro-framework for writing ssh-based commands written in Clojure. Similar to python's Fabric.
## Usage

1) lein uberjar
2) Define your commands/alerts in server-stats.cfg (look at the sample one)
3) java -jar serverStats-0.1-standalone.jar (this will print a man page, use -a to enable alerts)
